# Pitch Accent Trainer - User Guide

## Getting Started
1. Download and run `PitchAccentTrainer.exe`
2. The application will open with two empty plot areas and control buttons on the right

## Loading Native Audio/Video
1. Either:
   - Click "Load Native" and select an audio/video file
   - Or drag and drop an audio/video file onto the window
2. The native speaker's pitch curve will appear in the top plot
3. If the file contains video, a separate window will open showing the first frame. 
   I added this because in my use cases this usually shows the subtitle for the audio.

## Recording Your Voice
1. Click the "Record" button or press `R` to start recording
2. Speak into your microphone
3. Your pitch curve will appear in the bottom plot



## Playback Controls
- Press `Space` to play/stop the native audio
- Use the slider to adjust playback speed (50-100%)
- The black overlay shows the current playback position (approximately, this needs work)
- Set a delay (0-5000ms) between playback loops using the delay slider if the repetitions are too fast

## Video Screenshot Controls
- If your video appears sideways (common with iPhone videos):
  - Use `Left Arrow` key to rotate counterclockwise
  - Use `Right Arrow` key to rotate clockwise
- The video window can be:
  - Moved anywhere on your screen
  - Resized by dragging its edges
  - Hidden by unchecking "Show Video" checkbox

## Tips for Best Results
1. Use headphones and a good mic (devices can be selected at the top of the app window)
2. Record in a quiet environment
3. Keep a consistent distance from your microphone
4. Try to match the pitch patterns in the native audio
5. Use slower playback speeds to study detailed pitch movements
6. Watch the black overlay to see exactly when pitch changes occur (not precise, known issue)

## Practice Workflow
1. Load a native audio/video file
2. Listen to it a few times to understand the pitch pattern
3. Try recording yourself mimicking the pattern
4. Compare your pitch curve with the native speaker's
5. Adjust and re-record as needed

Remember: The pitch curves show how your voice rises and falls. Focus on matching the overall patterns rather than getting an exact match!
